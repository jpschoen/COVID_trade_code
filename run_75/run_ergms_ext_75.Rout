NOTE: Versions before 3.6.1 had a bug in the implementation of the bd()
constraint which distorted the sampled distribution somewhat. In
addition, Sampson's Monks datasets had mislabeled vertices. See the
NEWS and the documentation for more details.

NOTE: Some common term arguments pertaining to vertex attribute and
level selection have changed in 3.10.0. See terms help for more
details. Use ‘options(ergm.term=list(version="3.9.4"))’ to use old
behavior.

This model was fit using MCMC.  To examine model diagnostics and check
for degeneracy, use the mcmc.diagnostics() function.
14 13 14 15 Optimizing with step length 1.
The log-likelihood improved by 0.04926.
Step length converged twice. Stopping.
Finished MCMLE.
Note: Null model likelihood calculation is not implemented for valued
ERGMs at this time.  This means that all likelihood-based inference
(LRT, Analysis of Deviance, AIC, BIC, etc.) is only valid between
models with the same reference distribution and constraints.
